Who's next?\"\n\n[Hook]\nSaying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need\nAnd the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel\nAnd it feels so good\nIt feels so good\nIt feels so good\nIt feels so good\n\nI ain't scared of the fall\nI ain't scared of the fall\nI ain't scared of the fall\nI've felt the ground before\nI've felt the ground before\nI've felt the ground before\n\n[Bridge]\nThe fall\nAnd I ain't scared of the fall\n[Humming]\n\nXO\nXO\nXO\nXO\nXO", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/dncafws9usq8zvqlzr3k1fwby.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Weeknd"}
