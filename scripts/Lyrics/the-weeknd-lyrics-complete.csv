The reasons why I can't have you are easy to fix

... Around
Or whatever makes you feel like you the baddest bitch around

I know that your other man, I know that your other man
Got feelings for you,  got feelings for you...",
0,6 Inch Heel,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she's worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
Then she killed the fucking stage like an enemy

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar
Work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She tricking on herself she don't need a boss
(Don't you know) really ain't a thing to flaunt
(That two door) stunting with the ceilings on
Got these bitches in they feelings cause she paid it all
Used to have a man, wasn't meant to be
Made 100 bands, that's a century
Saving up for plans that would never be
She already made enough but she'll never leave

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
Falling from the sky, f-f-falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
F-f-falling from the sky, falling from the sky

[Verse 3: Belly]
Got a 100 bands I don't need a reason
Tell these bitches it's killing season
200 cash, she don't need a visa
Money, money all she believin'
300 flat, bitch left me freezin'
Balling, balling you play the bleachers
400 down, primp on the beach
Comin' round and everything on fleek

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she's worth every minute

[Outro]
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she's worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she's worth every minute",
0,Acquainted,"[Verse 1]
Baby you're no good
Cause they warned me 'bout your type girl, I've been ducking left and right
Baby you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

[Chorus]
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I get you touchin' on your body
I get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Verse 2]
Baby you're no good
All my niggas think I'm crazy' cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying

Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real,) yeah
'Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me (the fast life keeps gaining on me,) shit
But ever since I met you (ever since I met you)
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe
(Woooooh)

[Chorus]
I'll keep on touchin' on your body

[Outro]
I'm not tryna talk at all
Tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous",Beauty Behind the Madness
0,Adaptation,"[Intro]
When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us

[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

[Verse 1]
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

[Chorus]
But I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

[Verse 2]
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

[Bridge]
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

[Chorus 2]
Because I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one

[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye

Messin' up your carpet, I'll get on it after former
More sections of this yak on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' roll, but I fuckin' roll
Feelin' like a million bucks before
I walk through this door, when I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it, but I made it, that's for sure
For sure, your lovin', I need more, I need yours

She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on? They want what I'm sippin' on
They don't want my love, they just want my potential
Fuck it, I'll keep sippin' on this, baby livin' off of this
Got me drownin' in your love, you got me drownin' in abyss
Give me wet attention, I'll start drowning from my wrists, wrist

And baby if you need a little more
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you

Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind

Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise

Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

Cause you do this every day, okay

With this amount of touch, well

Even though I'd rather hold my tongue

Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing

A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland

Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear

Well, I love me too and I'm not afraid to say

Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby

I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing

If they're not down, better keep em out

I'm addied up, add it up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
’Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the Fall
Then it's time for me to fly out
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like

[Verse 2]
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, he can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

[Chorus]
And she gon' give it up cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up cause she know I might like it

Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me

Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy who
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all over now
Shout my nigga Stixx, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me

No flowers from her nigga out in Luxembourg
She came to Paris for a nigga
She want to introduce her parents to a nigga, shit
I just came from Milan, I had a threesome with two white bitches
Almost had a four but the black girl didn't even like bitches
I let her suck the dick, and passed her to my nigga
Bunch of bad bitches in Geneva
Twenty bottles in the club on my Visa
Smokin' like a Taylor at my table, uh
It's Pushaz Inc., the motherfuckin' label, and that XO
All my niggas on they think, we sold our souls to the devil
Local niggas say that, tell 'em to first get on my level

Chest feeling heavy like I'm pourin' up in Texas
Told a bitch come over give me a perm, spit some G to ya
Don't you tell these hoes what you learn, this is free for ya

Long dick reach deep down, in fallopian
Half Brazilian her ass was Amazonian
Dab by the slab, got you feeling like it's opium

Unless it's money me no hablo

When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me

Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show

I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion

[Verse 3]
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…

The title, ""M A N I A"", appears in bold, red capital letters.

[1: ""All I Know"" Scene]
Murphy the leopard is in the center of an arena-like area. A white light is flashing to the beat of the song. Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth.

[2: ""Sidewalks"" Scene]
Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song. There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running. Abel continues singing along to ""Sidewalks"" in his expensive vehicle. Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance.

[3: ""Secrets"" Scene]
There is ambience in the background. Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, gets out of his P1. He walks into the nightclub. ""Secrets"" begins to play and Abel sings along. Everybody in the club is dancing. There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her.

[4: ""Die For You"" Scene]
Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another. A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy. The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest. The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink. He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere. The music stops and Murphy roars.

[5: ""Party Monster"" Scene]
Abel is covered in blood. The man lays dead on the floor, still bleeding. The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit. She presumably saved Abel from being knifed. The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song  as it plays in the background. Cut to flashing blue lights.

[6: ""I Feel It Coming"" Outro Scene & Credits]
Abel is singing to the track. Him and his girl are seen stood where Murphy the leopard was sat in the area from the first scene.

Commitment is an enemy to me

Make me regret everything that I've done

Often imitated because this life I live is lavish

0,Open Letter to Fans,"To my fans

I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy

Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to ""spoon feed"" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence the pieces of her clothes coming off at every shot). The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist

This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint

Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight

Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out

My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Chorus: Daniel Wilson]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

0,Sidewalks (Joe Grayston & Brig Remix),"[Verse 1: Joe Grayston]
I, will be a star when I am 18
So, all of these haters will think I'm mainstream
Cause, too many sit back and just daydream
Well if, they step to me then they will be
Homeless, and corpse-less, these geezas bring no stress
I feel like Joseph, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you've got a problem then your girl single to me
Don't give a damn if you claim that you knew me
Grew up with no genre so nobody'll ever trust me
My flow so slick, some even say I'm too much, see?
I know it's gon' stick, I'll get all of you to love me
I feel you listen so I will be making money
Well, that's the life I'm tryna fantasize
Your bitch broke, be dropping down for 100 guys
Some day you will see me pulling up in Aventadors
Right now, I be grinding on them sidewalks

[Hook: Joe Grayston]

[Verse 2: Brig]
Say, say, say
I come from hustling jars for the pay day
Say, say, say
We hung all summer till dark tryna slang weight
Say, say, say
Writing songs in the garage while we play games
Say, say, say
You know its all for the squad how I maintained
Say, say, say
OG blunt, roll me one, only the KK
Then its bang bang
Lights out like the pg&e bill is overdue and ain't paid
And speaking of it shit it ain't paid
But I confess
That i contest
You tryna send
Me light for checks
And if i don’t comply then my lifes in debt
(Man that's fucked up!)
But that's just how the game go (game go)
Everybody tryna make dough (make dough)
All in it for the bankroll
They don’t give a fuck about the world
They would rather that it stayed broke
So I'm gathering the pesos
Tryna save me some so I can build a life
But they hate to see the real start to win
So they plot your downfall in the still of night
But that is ill advised cause I’m ready for it
I'm affraid to say that if you rain on my parade
Its a-okay cuz its already pouring
I embrace the rain and built a levy for it
To use it for my own advantage
Cack in the day when the people would hate it would get to me
I couldn't take it now see as motivation and demand it

They don't ever lie

42, but I fuck 'em like I'm 22
Backing and hanging that's all I do
I've been through aunties and mamas
Now its they daughters turn
I done ran through money but I got more to burn
Windows tinted, indo in it
I got that je ne sais quoi, a glass of Henny then muah
Here some freestyle, kiss them other lips wow
Bedroom bruises like we did Jiu-Jitsu
That official dick down
Spiritual chakras, frequency
I'm her holistic doctor, treatments frequently
Put her on a elevator to a higher self
Like Monte Carlo to acquire wealth
New dough I'm getting, the biggest my man hit me said 'let me hold something before them hoes get it'
OG flow, tailored clothes
The type to wear tuxedos with 40 belows
Can drop a BB out a spray-can
Driving down Cullens, Nas be wildin'
Rich nigga problems
I've been pimpin' since Big Pimpin', been pimpin'
Jazzy Jeff hoes out the door, Fresh Prince shit
Go tell a friend , bitch!

Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin

No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore

And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now

Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving

Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined

And I miss my city man it's been a minute

Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be

You can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me

And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you’ll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me

I never really heard that shit
I never really fucked his bitch
Never really hit a lick, goddamn
Never really saw through your shit
But right now I’m done with it, done with it
I told myself I passed this shit, past this shit
I guess it wasn’t evident, I ended it
Needed a new start, I’m confident
I pop these hoes like Vicodin
I grant my wishes, no Aladdin
But I’m landing, keep expanding
I get rich, my understanding
I drop tracks, they keep demanding
Take them drugs, they so relaxing
Fought the war, the only standing

Bitch I’m fucked up, time to drug up
I can’t feel my face, I’m so numb
When I call her I talk dumb
Babe it’s the drugs yo, not my tongue
I’m just having a little fun
Ain’t no time to see the sun
Hit and dip I’m always done
See the medal already won
Took the fight on the stage, yeah I’m winning
Fought my demons and now I’m grinning
I don’t eat twice a day, I’m thinning
Drink the lean and now I’m swinging
Ain’t like this from the beginning
Always talk bout my upbringing
I only rap on tracks, I let The Weeknd do the singing

I'm living like a coaster on them hill rolls (them hills fold)
When I'm fucked up that's the real me
Well the me that I'm happy with, the real me
When you see the problematic from the P.O.V
You wouldn't be ecstatic, you'd fear me
And I hate the fact I’m like a paperback
Take the taper back, I’d be okay with that
Make me relevant and I'll pay it back
Won’t drink it away but in case of that. (drink)

Last year, I asked who you were
A masterpiece and I forgot you swerved
A catastrophe like you smashed the curb
Cause your drive's intense, even asked your girls
When she called his phone, never answered her
So you left for me cause your ""man's a jerk""
Didn't know your price so he passed the urge
Didn't know double entendre what her ass is worth
Cause I left her numb like I snatched a nerve
Cheating on him, was that deserved?
But she never knew he set a trap for her
Always knew he was a bat for her
The passion, work, never seen though
She fell hard and bit dirt like a mean hoe
No pun intended but I'll leave girls
Hanging off of a tree, why love me girl
Always said she would let hope in
I guess ""hope"" is a guy, cause her legs' open
In her head, knows it, she's a yep, hoe bitch
Always said that she felt broken
I guess cheap things would break easy
Kept tellin' him ""I'll never leave you""
Tells me ""your next would never be me""
Guess that's the point, she'll never be you

I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (the money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (the money she be folding)

No call is worth stoppin'

0,To My Fans (Oct. 4),"To my fans

I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy

Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The 'Rolling Stone' video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence pieces of clothing off at every shot). The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist

This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to 'Trilogy'. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint

Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XO",

And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock your boots off
