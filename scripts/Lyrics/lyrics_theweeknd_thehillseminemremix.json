Like an ejector seat, from an F-15\nBut tonight we don't need those pills\nJust the effects of each other, but we gon' film\n'Cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that\u2026\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only fuck you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nAnd every time he hurt you, I heard you\nYour shoulder to cry on\nAnd I\u2019ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to\nYou said he drove you to my arms\nBut don\u2019t you know, remember when I told you\nI would never let down my guard?\nAnd I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you\n'Cause is it really over?\nBut you just want a little company\nAnd you just really wanna thrill-seek\nSaid you left him for good this time\nBullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?\nOr you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep\nBut these hills see from their POV, we can touch\nBut the only way you\u2019ll film me is with a camera, feel me?\nYou\u2019re nothin' but a barfly\nYou got your sights set on the one who you run to\nBut I\u2019m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true\nSo keep textin' me\nBut at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?\n'Cause if you cheat on him, just means I will be the next to be\nYour ex, so no complexities, just sex\nAnd don\u2019t lecture me, just accept that\u2026\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only fuck you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\n[Bridge: The Weeknd]\nHills have eyes, the hills have eyes\nWho are you to judge? Who are you to judge?\nHide your lies, girl, hide your lies\nOnly you to trust, only you\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only fuck you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\n[Outro: The Weeknd]\nEwedihalehu\nYene konjo, ewedihalehu\nYene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir\nYene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir\nEwedihalehu\nYene konjo, ewedihalehu", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a90504b5bd90f9f215207d846711797.650x650x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Weeknd"}
