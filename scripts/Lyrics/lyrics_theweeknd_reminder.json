Pow!), you know me (Know me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaid I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean\nFaded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion\nAll I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit\nIt just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit\nEverybody knows it, all these niggas know me\nPlatinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine\nPour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed\nI'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG\nAll my niggas get it, they make money all alone\nRock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home\nWhen I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show\nAnd I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know\nUsed to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor\nNow my shit straight\nEating all day, tryna lose weight\nThat good sex, we'll sweat it out\nHotel bed springs, we'll wear it out\nI ain't gotta tell you 'cause-\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know me (Oh-oh-oh)\nYou know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)\nYou know man, know man (Oh-oh-oh)\nYou know me, know me (Na-na-na-na-na)\nEvery time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)\nI'll be right there to remind you again (Hey!)\nYou know me (Pow! Pow!), you know me (Know me, know me)\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy don't you shake some, shake somethin'\nFor the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'\nBaby girl, won't you work some, work somethin'\nFor the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'\nBig girl, won't you shake some, shake somethin' (Shake some)\nFor the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'\nBaby girl, won't you work some (Work), work somethin'\nFor the Don? don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause you know me, they know me\nYou ain't know me, now you know me\nOh-oh-oh\nNa-na-na-na-na\nOh-oh-oh\nNa-na-na-na-na\nOh-oh-oh\nNa-na-na-na-na\nOh-oh-oh\nNa-na-na-na-na", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18632b71a26c116bdc7917574b38da9a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Weeknd"}
