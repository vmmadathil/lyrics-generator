(x3)\n\n[Verse 2: The Weeknd]\nI've been spending all my time, living for the thrill\nAll this money that I've thrown, All this liquor that I've spilled\nI deserve this\nI deserve her body on my mattress\nSo when you ask me what I do\nAll I do is hurt myself\nInspiration is\ufeff all I know\nInspiration is all I have\nSo I deserve this\nI deserve your body on my mattress\n\n[Verse 3: Thursday Girl]\nWhat do I do now that you're gone?\nWhat do I do when I'm alone?\nYou've been running in my head\nWhat do I do when\ufeff I need sex?\nYou're my everything\nYou're my heart\nYou're my everything\nYou're my heart\n\n[Verse 4: The Weeknd]\nI thought I told you, a long time ago\nDon't you fall in love..\nDon't make me make you fall in love...\nDon't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me\n\n[Outro]\nDon't you fall in love with a nigga like me.. (x6)\nLike me...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b1dcb4f0956e9cc12c1990ebf4dfd245.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Weeknd"}
