(drink)\n\n[Chorus]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that\u2019s the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\n[verse 2: Mayham]:\nLast year, I asked who you were\nA masterpiece and I forgot you swerved\nA catastrophe like you smashed the curb\nCause your drive's intense, even asked your girls\nWhen she called his phone, never answered her\nSo you left for me cause your \"man's a jerk\"\nDidn't know your price so he passed the urge\nDidn't know double entendre what her ass is worth\nCause I left her numb like I snatched a nerve\nCheating on him, was that deserved?\nBut she never knew he set a trap for her\nAlways knew he was a bat for her\nThe passion, work, never seen though\nShe fell hard and bit dirt like a mean hoe\nNo pun intended but I'll leave girls\nHanging off of a tree, why love me girl\nAlways said she would let hope in\nI guess \"hope\" is a guy, cause her legs' open\nIn her head, knows it, she's a yep, hoe bitch\nAlways said that she felt broken\nI guess cheap things would break easy\nKept tellin' him \"I'll never leave you\"\nTells me \"your next would never be me\"\nGuess that's the point, she'll never be you\nCause\n\n[Chorus]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\n[Bridge]\nHills have eyes, the hills have eyes\nWho are you to judge? Who are you to judge?\nHide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh baby)\nOnly you to trust, only you\n\n[Chorus]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\n[Outro]\nEwedihalehu\nYene konjo, ewedihalehu\nYene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir\nYene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3cd68c66d12d757c908ddbdcefb581e8.441x441x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Weeknd"}
