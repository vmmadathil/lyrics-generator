Am I late?\nThinking hard, got me going insane\n\n[Verse 1]\nBeaming through your door\nI see right through your faults\nEyes tryna feed me more lies\nGirl I\u2019m on top, of all your little side plans\nAll your little side mans\nAll in for your waist and I must have been out my mind\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nGirl you had to be so slick to go through all them\nBad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause\n\n[Hook]\nI\u2019m looking through you like an x-ray\nI\u2019m trying to figure if your love\u2019s fake\nGive or take, couple days\nShould I wait? Am I late?\nThinking hard, got me going insane\n\nI\u2019m looking through you like an x-ray\nI\u2019m trying find out if your heart breaks\nCan it break? Is it fake?\nShould I wait? Am I late?\nThinking hard, got me going insane\n\n[Verse 2]\nRunning through them boys\nYou play me like a toy\nAnd 'bout to here that noise\nWhen I find out your thoughts girl\nSweating on the outside shaking on the inside\nGirl I\u2019m reading your mind\nAnd it's filled with lies\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nGirl you had to be so slick to go through all them\nBad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause\n\n[Hook]\nI\u2019m looking through you like an x-ray\nI\u2019m trying to figure if your love\u2019s fake\nGive or take, couple days\nShould I wait?
